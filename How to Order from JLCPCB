### Step 1: Prepare the Design in KiCad
1. **Complete Your PCB Design**: Ensure your design is fully completed in KiCad, including all schematics and PCB layout.
2. **Run DRC (Design Rule Check)**: Before exporting, run a DRC to catch any errors that might affect the PCB manufacturing.

To create an order from JLCPCB, you will need 4 sets of files - Gerber, Drill, BOM, and Drill map.

### Step 2: Generate Gerber Files
1. **Open PCB Layout Editor**: In KiCad, open the PCB layout tool.

2. **Generate Gerbers**:
   - Go to `File > Plot` in the PCB layout tool.
   - Choose **Gerber** as the plot format.
   - Select the necessary layers:
     - **F.Cu** (Front Copper)
     - **B.Cu** (Back Copper)
     - **F.Mask** (Front Solder Mask)
     - **B.Mask** (Back Solder Mask)
     - **F.SilkS** (Front Silkscreen)
     - **B.SilkS** (Back Silkscreen)
     - **Edge.Cuts** (Board outline)
   - Select appropriate options for drill files, including through-hole and vias.
   - Click `Plot` to generate Gerber files.

3. **Export Drill Files**:
   - After plotting, click on the **Generate Drill Files** button.
   - Choose **Excellon** format, and make sure to include **PTH (Plated Through-Hole)** and **NPTH (Non-Plated Through-Hole)**.

### Step 3: Zip the Gerber Files
1. After generating all the Gerber files and drill files, zip them into a single compressed folder. Make sure all necessary layers are included in the zip file.

### Step 4: BOM file
1. After generating all the Gerber files and drill files, zip them into a single compressed folder. Make sure all necessary layers are included in the zip file.

### Step 5: Go to JLCPCB’s Website
1. **Visit JLCPCB**: Navigate to [JLCPCB’s website](https://jlcpcb.com/).
2. **Register or Log In**: If you don’t have an account, create one. If you do, simply log in.

### Step 6: Upload Gerber Files to JLCPCB
1. On the JLCPCB homepage, click the **“Order Now”** button under the PCB manufacturing section.
2. **Upload the ZIP File** containing your Gerber files.
3. JLCPCB will automatically analyze the files and present you with a preview of your board.

### Step 7: Configure PCB Options
1. Review the auto-generated preview to ensure it matches your design.
2. Customize the PCB:
   - **Dimensions**: This should be automatically detected from the Gerber files.
   - **Layers**: Typically 2-layer or 4-layer, depending on your design.
   - **Quantity**: Choose the number of PCBs you need.
   - **Thickness**: Common options are 1.6mm, but you can choose different thicknesses depending on your needs.
   - **Solder Mask Color**: Green is standard, but other colors are available.
   - **Silkscreen Color**: White is typical.
   - **Surface Finish**: Choose between HASL (Lead/Lead-Free) or ENIG (Gold).

### Step 8: Review and Order
1. **Double-check the Design**: Make sure the files, PCB settings, and quantity are correct.
2. **Choose Shipping**: Select the preferred shipping option based on time and cost.
3. **Payment**: Complete the order by choosing a payment method (e.g., PayPal, credit card).

### Step 9: Wait for Your PCBs
1. JLCPCB will process the order and provide you with tracking information once the boards are manufactured and shipped.
2. The company will most likely contact you to sign off on TK one to multiple errors which will extend production and shipping length

Following these steps ensures a smooth experience when ordering PCBs from JLCPCB using KiCad.
