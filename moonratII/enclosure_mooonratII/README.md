Note that there is a V Cut by which the right "Heater" asembly is to be seperated from the "Controler" assembly which this does not represent.

Parametric spread sheet design methodology.

Below are the photos of my attempt to construct a system to take to Tanzania.

Note there are several changes to the system that Silvia made that this has taught me:

1) We want to make the "top" higher so that there is room for the headers. Additionally, the raised top needs to be made a bit longer so that the full headers will fit. (One might argue that we don't actually need the headers, but I believe we should manufacture for flexbility.)
2) I used a hacksaw to cut out the port for the Arduino UNO USB port. We definitely want to be able to attach and resprogram without opening the case, just as we can (now) attach the battery cable. This provides more flexibility.
3) I could not figure out how to screw down the board. Possibly the "posts" did not print well, but the best way to do this is make them large enough to add brass female inserts (which are adhered by making them hot so that the melt in.)
4) The buttons still don't work. We probably need to redesign the board to fix that problem.
5) This vacuum flask takes 2.5 turns of the lid to tighten. The 9V battery connectors I use easily twist that much; so I am happy with some sort of "internal quick disconnect."
