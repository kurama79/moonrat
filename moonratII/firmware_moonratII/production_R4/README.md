# Arduino R4 Firmware

Here it is funded different prototyping versions of the firmware:
- Testing digital sensor
- Testing Fuzzy controller
- Testing PID controller
- Testing display merged with some controller (PID and Fuzzy versions)

The latest commit includes the **experimental** (solving some issues) complete version of the firmware, which provides for "#define" selections for the hardware (between R3 and R4) and the controller (PID and Fuzzy). It also includes code modifications for the new digital sensor (DS18B20).
